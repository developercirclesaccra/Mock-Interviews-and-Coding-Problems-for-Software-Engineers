# Mock Interviews and Coding Problems for Software Engineers.

Practicing Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, and System Design Problems

## Directory Structure and File naming

We name each file in this format: MockInterviewPractice[Week Number].[Language used for the solution]
With week one, we officially launched Mock Interviews and Coding Problems for Software Engineers program hence there was no practice questions.

Actual practices started from week 2.
