# Mock Interviews and Coding Problems for Software Engineers.
 Practicing Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, and System Design Problems

 ## Directory Structure and File naming 
 
We name each file in this format:  MockInterviewPractice[Week Number].[Language used for the solution] 
With week one, we officially launched Mock Interviews and Coding Problems for Software Engineers program hence there was no practice questions. 

Actual practices started from week 2.
